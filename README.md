## LDTS_l04_gr03 - Space Invaders

This project is a re-adaption of the classical game Space Invaders, released in 1978 for the arcade video game machines and later to other platforms.
The objective is to defeat a wave of descending aliens with a horizontally moving laser and earn as many points as possible by killing them and stop the invasion.

The player controls a spaceship that can shoot lasers. The game ends when the player is shot and has no lives left. The player can also collect some power ups that can help him.

### Project Main Goals
